The source code behind [RTOOT.org](https://rtoot.org/).

The site is based on [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/). The [Lektor documentation on content](https://www.getlektor.com/docs/content/) is a good place to start for learning how to edit pages on the site. The content of most pages is mostly [Markdown](https://kirkstrobeck.github.io/whatismarkdown.com/), the exception is the "For Players" page which is CSV.
